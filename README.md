# Clinical Data for Potential Cure of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Tumor

## Project Description
This repository contains clinical data from tests conducted on 248 mice as part of a research study searching for a potential cure for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) tumor. The mice were subjected to different treatment regimens using a range of drug interventions. The data collected during the study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of various drug regimens in managing SCC tumor growth.

## Analysis Summary
The dataset is analyzed using various statistical and data visualization techniques to gain insights into the efficacy of different drug regimens. Key analyses include:

Comparison of mean and median tumor volumes across different drug regimens
Evaluation of the variance and standard deviation of tumor volumes within each drug regimen
Calculation of the correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume
Examination of the distribution of tumor volumes over time for specific drug regimens
Identification of any potential outliers or extreme observations within the dataset

## Observations and Conclusions
 The mean and median tumor volumes vary across different drug regimens. Capomulin and Ramicane have a relatively lower mean and median tumor volumes compared to other drug regimens like Ketapril, Naftisol, and Placebo. This suggests that Capomulin and Ramicane might be more effective in reducing tumor volume.

 The data provides information on the central tendency, variability, and SEM of tumor volume for different drug regimens. These observations can be used to compare the effectiveness and consistency of different treatments in reducing tumor size.

## Repository Contents
- `M_5_Challenge` Folder: Containing 'pymaceuticals_starter' file containing the code, '3 Observations.txt', and Readme.md. 
- `data' folder: Contains 2 .csv files 'Study_results' and 'Mouse_metadata' - The original dataset used for the analysis.
- `Readme.md`: This file, provides an overview of the project and its findings.

## Instructions
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies - Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy and Numpy.
3. Open the `pymaceuticals_starter` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Read both files from the Data folder and merge them.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate the results.
